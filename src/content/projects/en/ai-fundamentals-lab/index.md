### 🚀 About the Lab
This laboratory brings together a series of fundamental developments carried out during my academic stay in **Japan**. The main objective was to delve deep into how intelligent systems perceive their environment and make decisions based on logical rules and mathematical models.

### 🛠️ Technologies and Methodologies
For these developments, I used **Python** as the primary language, relying on specialized libraries for each area:
* **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Use of `hmmlearn` to predict hidden states.
* **Knowledge Representation:** Implementation of semantic graphs with `NetworkX`.
* **Evolutionary Computation:** Development of genetic algorithms from scratch.

### 🔑 Featured Modules
* **Agent Architecture:** Evolution from simple reflex agents to model-based agents with the ability to track internal states and manage environmental uncertainty.
* **Inference Engines:** Implementation of forward chaining systems for the automatic deduction of new facts from a rule base.
* **Evolutionary Optimization:** Search system based on natural selection, crossover, and mutation to find optimal solutions in complex search spaces.
* **Semantic Graphs:** Visualization and querying of ontologies that allow attribute inheritance between entities.
