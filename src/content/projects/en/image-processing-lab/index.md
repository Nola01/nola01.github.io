### 🚀 About the Project
Developed during my academic stay in **Japan**, this toolkit focuses on the application of **Computer Vision** algorithms to extract valuable information from visual data. The primary goal was to understand the underlying mathematics behind each filter and transformation.

### 🛠️ Technologies and Tools
* **OpenCV:** Core library for all vision operations and pixel matrix manipulation.
* **NumPy:** Efficient processing of images treated as multidimensional arrays.
* **Matplotlib:** Generation of visual comparisons to analyze the impact of filters and transformations.

### 🔑 Key Features
* **Shape and Object Detection:** Utilization of the Hough Transform to identify and count circular objects (coins) and linear structures (road lanes).
* **Advanced Segmentation:** Application of **K-Means Clustering** to simplify images through dominant color quantization.
* **Feature Extraction:** Implementation of gradient operators (Prewitt) and corner detectors (Harris) to identify structural boundaries.
* **Preprocessing:** Image enhancement pipelines using histogram equalization (CLAHE), Gaussian smoothing, and box filters for noise reduction.
