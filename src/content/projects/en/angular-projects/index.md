### 🚀 About the Lab
This section brings together three developments focused on solving common frontend challenges: state management, real-time data filtering, and asynchronous communication with external services.

Despite their visual simplicity, each application served to consolidate key **Angular** concepts such as dependency injection, component-based modularization, and data stream management using **Observables**.

### 🛠️ Included Projects

#### 1. Superhero Wiki
An interactive superhero encyclopedia.
* **Technical Focus:** Setting up a local data server (**JSON-server**) to simulate a REST database. Implementation and testing of **Auth Guards** for protected route management.
* **Functionality:** Query operations on a local data model, optimized search, and route protection logic experienced during development.
* You can check the code in the [**GitHub**](https://github.com/Nola01/heroes-app) repository.

#### 2. Country Explorer
A geographical query tool based on a REST API.
* **Technical Focus:** Use of child routes and URL parameter passing to display detailed information for each country.
* **Functionality:** Search by name, region, and capital, along with the visualization of data such as flags and population.
* You can check the code in the [**GitHub**](https://github.com/Nola01/countries-app) repository.

#### 3. GIF Search
An animation search engine integrated with the Giphy API.
* **Technical Focus:** Local persistence using *LocalStorage* to maintain the user's search history.
* **Functionality:** An organized image gallery with search results and a sidebar implementation displaying the search history.
* You can check the code in the [**GitHub**](https://github.com/Nola01/gifs-app) repository.

### 🔑 Consolidated Competencies
* **RxJS:** Management of HTTP requests and operators to transform data streams.
* **Modularization:** Folder structure based on functional and shared modules (Shared Modules).
* **Clean Code:** Strict separation of concerns between Services (logic) and Components (view).
