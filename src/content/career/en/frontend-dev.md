During my six-month stay at Bosonit, I developed my technical profile in two distinct stages:

### 📚 Technical Training Phase (March — June)
During the first quarter, I focused on intensive training in modern web development technologies. I delved deep into the **Angular** ecosystem, perfecting the use of **TypeScript** and **JavaScript** fundamentals (ES6+), applying component architectures and state management.

### 🌍 European Real Estate Project (June — September)
In the second stage, I joined a professional team to develop a European-level web platform within the **Real Estate** sector. 

* **Scope:** The application was designed to operate simultaneously across several countries, managing different languages.
* **Collaboration:** I worked under Agile methodologies, collaborating closely with backend and design profiles to implement functional and scalable interfaces.
* **Technologies:** Direct application of the knowledge acquired in Angular and TypeScript within a high-demand real-world production environment.

After successfully completing this period, I decided to conclude my stage at the company to begin my [**Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering**](/en/career/university-studies) studies. My goal was to complement this practical foundation with a solid academic background that would allow me to delve deeper into the fundamentals of computing and software development.
